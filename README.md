# AWS Resource Usage Reporter

## Overview

This project provides a shell script that fetches the usage data of various AWS resources such as **S3 buckets**, **EC2 instances**, **Lambda functions**, and **IAM users**. The data is then saved into a report file, making it easy to track and audit your AWS resources.

Additionally, the script can be scheduled to run automatically using a **cron job** at a specified time every day (e.g., 9 AM), ensuring that resource usage reports are generated regularly.

## Features

- **Fetches AWS Resource Data**:
  - Lists **S3 buckets**
  - Lists **EC2 instances**
  - Lists **Lambda functions**
  - Lists **IAM users**

- **Logging**:
  - Logs output and errors to a log file for easier debugging.
  - Appends the results of each command to a report file.

- **Automated Scheduling**:
  - Configures a **cron job** to run the script at a specified time (e.g., every day at 9 AM).

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **AWS CLI**: The script uses the AWS CLI to interact with your AWS resources. If you don’t have it installed, follow the [AWS CLI installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).
- **jq**: A command-line tool for processing JSON. If you don’t have it installed, follow the [jq installation guide](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).
- **AWS Credentials**: The script assumes that your AWS credentials (Access Key and Secret Key) are properly configured. Run `aws configure` to set them up.

## Usage

1. **Download the Script**

   Clone the repository or download the script.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-resource-usage-reporter.git
   cd aws-resource-usage-reporter
   ```

2. **Make the Script Executable**

   If you haven't already, ensure the script has executable permissions:

   ```bash
   chmod +x resource_report.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script Manually**

   To generate a resource usage report manually, run the script:

   ```bash
   ./resource_report.sh
   ```

   The output will be saved to `resourceTracker.txt` and logs will be written to `scriptExecution.log`.

4. **Schedule the Script with a Cron Job**

   You can set up the script to run automatically at 9 AM every day using a cron job.

   To add a cron job:
   - Open the crontab configuration:

     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```

   - Add the following line to schedule the script to run daily at 9 AM:

     ```bash
     0 9 * * * /path/to/your/resource_report.sh >> /path/to/your/logfile.log 2>&1
     ```

     Replace `/path/to/your/resource_report.sh` with the actual path to the script, and `/path/to/your/logfile.log` with the desired location for the log file.

   - Save and exit the editor.

   This will execute the script every day at 9 AM, and the results will be logged.

5. **View the Generated Report**

   After the script runs, the generated report will be saved in `resourceTracker.txt`. You can review the file to see the list of resources retrieved.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission Issues**: Ensure your AWS user/role has the required permissions to access EC2, Lambda, IAM, and S3 resources. You can attach the necessary IAM policies to the user.
- **Missing jq**: If you get errors related to `jq`, ensure it is installed by running `jq --version`.
- **AWS CLI Configuration**: If you're getting authentication errors, make sure your AWS CLI is configured with valid credentials using `aws configure`.

### Notes:
- **Replace the URLs**: Make sure to update the repository URL (`https://github.com/yourusername/aws-resource-usage-reporter.git`) with the correct one for your project.
- **Error Handling**: The README assumes the user is familiar with basic shell scripting and AWS. If needed, you could elaborate more on error messages or logging for troubleshooting.
