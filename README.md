# AWS_-Resources
This project automates the generation of an AWS resource usage report using a Bash script. The script fetches details about S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, and IAM users and saves the output to a file. A cron job can be set up to schedule this script to run at regular intervals.
